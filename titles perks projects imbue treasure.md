# Draw Steel Titles, Projects, Perks, and Imbue Treasure Compendium

This document details the character rewards and progression mechanics for Titles, Downtime Projects, Perks, and Imbue Treasure Enhancements in *Draw Steel*.

***

## I. Titles

Titles are special rewards earned through mighty deeds and heroic tasks that grant abilities or benefits. They are awarded by the Director after a hero defeats a powerful monster, researches forbidden lore, or completes a heroic task.

| Echelon | Level Range | Typical Narrative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Echelon** | 1st to 3rd Level | Local heroes overcoming minor threats. |
| **2nd Echelon** | 4th to 6th Level | Regional heroes known across a country or large city. |
| **3rd Echelon** | 7th to 9th Level | Heroes known throughout the setting (continent or world). |
| **4th Echelon** | 10th Level | Heroes saving the entire timescape from major threats. |

### Title Benefits

When the party earns a title:

1.  **Individual Titles:** If the title results from an individual accomplishment (such as surviving a particular fate), only that hero gains the single benefit.
2.  **Group Titles:** If earned collectively, the title often presents several options (typically three or four). Each player chooses one of these benefits for their hero.
