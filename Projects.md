# Draw Steel Downtime Projects Compendium

Downtime Projects are formal tasks undertaken by heroes during a **Respite**,. These activities allow heroes to pursue individual goals such as crafting supernatural gear or undertaking intricate research.

Heroes track their progress using Project Points (PP) toward a required **Project Goal**,. Only one project may be worked on per respite unless the hero employs followers.
